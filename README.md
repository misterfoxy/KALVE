# KALVE

## About This Application

What I attemtped to create is  an application that exists to rethink the custom apparel process. The industry is plagued with novel long email correspondence, communication breakdowns, outrageous prices, and a lack of strong tech. 

With Kalve, I set out to rethink the order process, highlighting what questions are most important between both parties during a proof
request. After reviewing many of our request emails from clients, the standouts demands where for type of shirts, color, quantity, and price. Kalve is a full-stack application, which allows for dynamic page updates using bleeding-edge technology. Each category carries with it the available colors, and price(both in total, or unit). Currently, the application is optimized for Tee Shirts, but I hope to add the rest of my inventory, including hats, outerwear, swimsuits, towels, embroidery work, and athletic apparel.

## Development Information
Kalve was developed using the MERN stack. MongoDB is used for storing information about orders, pricing models, and users. Express is used for routing and server logic. React is used for the dynamic order-form. Node is used for package management and incorporating additional dependencies. 

Additional dependencies include:
>stripe
>bcrypt
>react-router




## Future Development

A simplified application is only the first steps for this software. Next major steps in development include single unit shipping, social interactivity, crowdfunding, persistent stores, order design software, friend/global activity feeds, and much more.
